# Inspiration
When we were beginning to learn how to code, visualizing sorting algorithms on various data structures was very complicated and hard to visualize.

# What it does
Our Data Visualizer takes in an array of numbers and allows the user to select different sorting algorithms. Our Visualizer then shows all the steps from the beginning to the end of the sorting algorithm. Also, the numbers can be displayed in an AVL tree. This website is also connected to a Twitter Bot that takes in user data and implements the same functionality as the website.

# How I built it
We used JavaScript, NodeJs, D3, CSS, and html

# Challenges I ran into
We just started learning JavaScript and its libraries. There was a very steep learning curve.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We are very proud of taking on a project outside of our initial skill set. We learned a lot about web servers, and website coding languages.

# Planning



## Data Types

* Arrays
* Linked List
	* Single
* Trees
	* AVL
* HashMaps/HashTrees 

--

* Customization Oriented
* Python App Engine (most likely)
* Plotly
* Tkinter
* Tweepy


--

* Input bar across the bottom. Button on the right hand side of the bar. As you add numbers, you can click and add single/multiple. Seperated by commas
* Top bar with tabs of different computed visualizations
* Button on top right to select new data type/visualization
* Middle is like wolfram alpha. Gives summary then you click on it to breakout and give you more info.
*
